## Stage 1
1. Come up with a header for your future site and wrap it in a proper tag for a first-level heading.
2. Create a second-level heading with the text "About me".
3. Place your photo or any image that will represent you.
4. Put at least one paragraph of text on the site: this will be the personal biography section.
5. Create another second-level heading with the text "Portfolio".
6. Place at least one image that will represent your work experience and achievements.
7. Put a title or a project name under each image so that they don't appear out of context.

## Stage 2
* Create a website header and place your `<h1>` element in it.
* Decide which elements you want to place in your biography block, group them with the `<section>` tag, and add the about id to this tag.
* Group the elements in the "Portfolio" section the same way. In this case, use the tag `<section>` and the id portfolio.
* Using the tag `<section>`, —Åreate another section with the id contacts and place your contact information in it.
* Create a footer; you can put any information in the footer.
* Add a navigation bar with anchor links to blocks with the id's about, portfolio, and contacts. Make the navigation bar part of the site's header.

## Stage 3
Reset default margins and paddings so that all the elements are displayed with the same indentation in different browsers.
Use CSS Grid or Flexbox to rearrange the elements of the web page as you like.
Change the height of the header of your site.
Change the background color of the site header or set a cool background image.
Set the height and width of the images on your site.
Change the height of the footer of your site.
Change the background color of the site footer.
Add styles to other elements: this is up to you! You can also create additional HTML elements if you wish.

## Stage 4
* In front of each project/achievement, add a button that will trigger a pop-up window when pressed. Specify the `open-window` class for the buttons.
* In an HTML file, create a pop-up template. Add the `window` class to the tag in which your window will be wrapped.
* Write a script so that the pop-up window with the necessary information appears when the button is pressed.
* Complete your script so that the window can close.
* Write styles for your new elements.

## Stage 5
* In the HTML file, create an element with an icon that will open the navigation menu when pressed on mobile devices.
* Use CSS to make this icon appear on your site when you view it on devices with smaller screen sizes. The `@media` rule and the `display` or `visibility` property will help you do this.
* Create the menu itself. Set the `hamburger` class to the tag that wraps the menu elements.
* Specify the properties for the menu so that it is located where you want it.
* Write a script so that when you click the menu icon, it opens and the icon appearance changes (see the examples).
* Complete your program so that the menu closes when you click the icon.
* Make sure that other elements of your site also display okay on different devices and in different browsers. If necessary, adjust your code.
